Back in the good old days -- the "Golden Era" of computers, it
was easy to separate the men from the boys (sometimes called "Real
Men" and "Quiche Eaters" in the literature). During this period, the
Real Men were the ones that understood computer programming, and the
Quiche Eaters were the ones that didn't.  A real computer programmer
said things like "DO 10 I=1,10" and "ABEND" (they actually talked in
capital letters, you understand), and the rest of the world said
things like "computers are too complicated for me" and "I can't relate
to computers -- they're so impersonal". (A previous work [1] points
out that Real Men don't "relate" to anything, and aren't afraid of
being impersonal.)
